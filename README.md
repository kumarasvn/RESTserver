Trivial Node/Express Server
===========================

This is a trivial http server built with node and express. It expects
to serve JSON data, with all four main HTTP methods. 
The data are stored in a simple JavaScript object structure, which
facilitates easy creation of new keys along with some initialized
data, and then deploying the server to support classroom lab exercises
that require a minimal REST service to operate against.
